### Hello People ðŸ”­
I'm a student in a small city called Toulouse in France, <br>
studying software engineering and game development for my 2nd year as of early 2023.
I spend my years helping the younger student and having trouble with making c++ compiling work on my machine instead of working on my own project.

I dream of a world where Bogosort is O(1), where error message become a thing of the past.
A world without compile time, where variable name THEMSELVES.
Some may say its impossible, that this vision will never become reality but I, I believe, that one day even Miranda from the marketing departement
can describe the need of the client. Through sheer power of will, we will do it.

but before that need I this compiler to work.


Anyway,
Its been a while now - still don't work - and I think I am ready to really present myself.
Call me ElKariboosama, as I said i'm a student, nearly 20 year old and my back is starting to hurt.
That's it I'm old and it shows.

I work in C and C++ but I can still relate with the younger audience with my Python and Go skills.
Webdev isn't my cup of tea but I manage.
